# Examples
The `pympipool.Executor` extends the interface of the [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
to simplify the up-scaling of individual functions in a given workflow.

## Compatibility
Starting with the basic example of `1+1=2`. With the `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
standard library this can be written as - `test_thread.py`: 
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

with ThreadPoolExecutor(
    max_workers=1,
) as exe:
    future = exe.submit(sum, [1, 1])
    print(future.result())
```
In this case `max_workers=1` limits the number of threads used by the `ThreadPoolExecutor` to one. Then the `sum()`
function is submitted to the executor with a list with two ones `[1, 1]` as input. A [`concurrent.futures.Future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
object is returned. The `Future` object allows to check the status of the execution with the `done()` method which 
returns `True` or `False` depending on the state of the execution. Or the main process can wait until the execution is 
completed by calling `result()`. 

This example stored in a python file named `test_thread.py` can be executed using the python interpreter: 
```
python test_thread.py
>>> 2
```
The result of the calculation is `1+1=2`. 

The `pympipool.Executor` class extends the interface of the [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures) 
class by providing more parameters to specify the level of parallelism. In addition, to specifying the maximum number 
of workers `max_workers` the user can also specify the number of cores per worker `cores_per_worker` for MPI based 
parallelism, the number of threads per core `threads_per_core` for thread based parallelism and the number of GPUs per
worker `gpus_per_worker`. Finally, for those backends which support over-subscribing this can also be enabled using the 
`oversubscribe` parameter. All these parameters are optional, so the `pympipool.Executor` can be used as a drop-in 
replacement for the [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures).

The previous example is rewritten for the `pympipool.Executor` in - `test_sum.py`:
```python
from pympipool import Executor 

with Executor(
    max_workers=1, 
    cores_per_worker=1, 
    threads_per_core=1, 
    gpus_per_worker=0, 
    oversubscribe=False
) as exe:
    future = exe.submit(sum, [1,1])
    print(future.result())
```
Again this example can be executed with the python interpreter: 
```
python test_sum.py
>>> 2
```
The result of the calculation is again `1+1=2`.

Beyond pre-defined functions like the `sum()` function, the same functionality can be used to submit user-defined 
functions. In the `test_serial.py` example a custom summation function is defined: 
```python
from pympipool import Executor

def calc(*args):
    return sum(*args)

with Executor(max_workers=2) as exe:
    fs_1 = exe.submit(calc, [2, 1])
    fs_2 = exe.submit(calc, [2, 2])
    fs_3 = exe.submit(calc, [2, 3])
    fs_4 = exe.submit(calc, [2, 4])
    print([
        fs_1.result(), 
        fs_2.result(), 
        fs_3.result(), 
        fs_4.result(),
    ])
```
In contrast to the previous example where just a single function was submitted to a single worker, in this case a total
of four functions is submitted to a group of two workers `max_workers=2`. Consequently, the functions are executed as a
set of two pairs. 

The script can be executed with any python interpreter:
```
python test_serial.py
>>> [3, 4, 5, 6]
```
It returns the corresponding sums as expected. The same can be achieved with the built-in [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
classes. Still one advantage of using the `pympipool.Executor` rather than the built-in ones, is the ability to execute 
the same commands in interactive environments like [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). This is achieved by using 
[cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) to serialize the python function and its parameters rather than
the regular pickle package. 

For backwards compatibility with the [`multiprocessing.Pool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) 
class the [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
also implements the `map()` function to map a series of inputs to a function. The same `map()` function is also 
available in the `pympipool.Executor` - `test_map.py`: 
```python
from pympipool import Executor

def calc(*args):
    return sum(*args)

with Executor(max_workers=2) as exe:
    print(list(exe.map(calc, [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4]])))
```
Again the script can be executed with any python interpreter:
```
python test_map.py
>>> [3, 4, 5, 6]
```
The results remain the same. 

## Data Handling
A limitation of many parallel approaches is the overhead in communication when working with large datasets. Instead of
reading the same dataset repetitively, the `pympipool.Executor` loads the dataset only once per worker and afterwards 
each function submitted to this worker has access to the dataset, as it is already loaded in memory. To achieve this
the user defines an initialization function `init_function` which returns a dictionary with one key per dataset. The 
keys of the dictionary can then be used as additional input parameters in each function submitted to the `pympipool.Executor`.
This functionality is illustrated in the `test_data.py` example: 
```python
from pympipool import Executor

def calc(i, j, k):
    return i + j + k

def init_function():
    return {"j": 4, "k": 3, "l": 2}

with Executor(max_workers=1, init_function=init_function) as exe:
    fs = exe.submit(calc, 2, j=5)
    print(fs.result())
```
The function `calc()` requires three inputs `i`, `j` and `k`. But when the function is submitted to the executor only 
two inputs are provided `fs = exe.submit(calc, 2, j=5)`. In this case the first input parameter is mapped to `i=2`, the
second input parameter is specified explicitly `j=5` but the third input parameter `k` is not provided. So the 
`pympipool.Executor` automatically checks the keys set in the `init_function()` function. In this case the returned 
dictionary `{"j": 4, "k": 3, "l": 2}` defines `j=4`, `k=3` and `l=2`. For this specific call of the `calc()` function,
`i` and `j` are already provided so `j` is not required, but `k=3` is used from the `init_function()` and as the `calc()`
function does not define the `l` parameter this one is also ignored. 

Again the script can be executed with any python interpreter:
```
python test_data.py
>>> 10
```
The result is `2+5+3=10` as `i=2` and `j=5` are provided during the submission and `k=3` is defined in the `init_function()`
function.

## Up-Scaling 
The availability of certain features depends on the backend `pympipool` is installed with. In particular the thread 
based parallelism and the GPU assignment is only available with the `pympipool.slurm.PySlurmExecutor` or the 
`pympipool.flux.PyFluxExecutor` backend. The latter is recommended based on the easy installation, the faster allocation 
of resources as the resources are managed within the allocation and no central databases is used and the superior level 
of fine-grained resource assignment which is typically not available on other HPC resource schedulers including the
[SLURM workload manager](https://www.schedmd.com). The `pympipool.flux.PyFluxExecutor` requires 
[flux framework](https://flux-framework.org) to be installed in addition to the `pympipool` package. The features are 
summarized in the table below: 

|     Feature \ Backend      | `PyMpiExecutor` | `PySlurmExecutor` | `PyFluxExecutor` |
|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
|  Thread based parallelism  |       no        |        yes        |       yes        | 
|   MPI based parallelism    |       yes       |        yes        |       yes        |
|       GPU assignment       |       no        |        yes        |       yes        |
| Resource over-subscription |       yes       |        yes        |        no        |
|        Scalability         |     1 node      |    ~100 nodes     |     no limit     |

### Thread-based Parallelism
The number of threads per core can be controlled with the `threads_per_core` parameter during the initialization of the 
`pympipool.Executor`. Unfortunately, there is no uniform way to control the number of cores a given underlying library 
uses for thread based parallelism, so it might be necessary to set certain environment variables manually: 

* `OMP_NUM_THREADS`: for openmp
* `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS`: for openblas
* `MKL_NUM_THREADS`: for mkl
* `VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS`: for accelerate on Mac Os X
* `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS`: for numexpr

At the current stage `pympipool.Executor` does not set these parameters itself, so you have to add them in the function
you submit before importing the corresponding library: 

```python
def calc(i):
    import os
    os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = "2"
    os.environ["OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS"] = "2"
    os.environ["MKL_NUM_THREADS"] = "2"
    os.environ["VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS"] = "2"
    os.environ["NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS"] = "2"
    import numpy as np
    return i
```

Most modern CPUs use hyper-threading to present the operating system with double the number of virtual cores compared to
the number of physical cores available. So unless this functionality is disabled `threads_per_core=2` is a reasonable 
default. Just be careful if the number of threads is not specified it is possible that all workers try to access all 
cores at the same time which can lead to poor performance. So it is typically a good idea to monitor the CPU utilization
with increasing number of workers. 

Specific manycore CPU models like the Intel Xeon Phi processors provide a much higher hyper-threading ration and require
a higher number of threads per core for optimal performance. 

### MPI Parallel Python Functions
Beyond thread based parallelism, the message passing interface (MPI) is the de facto standard parallel execution in 
scientific computing and the [`mpi4py`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io) bindings to the MPI libraries are commonly used
to parallelize existing workflows. The limitation of this approach is that it requires the whole code to adopt the MPI
communication standards to coordinate the way how information is distributed. Just like the `pympipool.Executor` the 
[`mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mpi4py.futures.html#mpipoolexecutor) 
implements the [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
interface. Still in this case eah python function submitted to the executor is still limited to serial execution. The
novel approach of the `pympipool.Executor` is mixing these two types of parallelism. Individual functions can use
the [`mpi4py`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io) library to handle the parallel execution within the context of this 
function while these functions can still me submitted to the `pympipool.Executor` just like any other function. The
advantage of this approach is that the users can parallelize their workflows one function at the time. 

The example in `test_mpi.py` illustrates the submission of a simple MPI parallel python function: 
```python
from pympipool import Executor

def calc(i):
    from mpi4py import MPI
    size = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size()
    rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
    return i, size, rank

with Executor(cores_per_worker=2) as exe:
    fs = exe.submit(calc, 3)
    print(fs.result())
```
The `calc()` function initializes the [`mpi4py`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io) library and gathers the size of the 
allocation and the rank of the current process within the MPI allocation. This function is then submitted to an 
`pympipool.Executor` which is initialized with a single worker with two cores `cores_per_worker=2`. So each function
call is going to have access to two cores. 

Just like before the script can be called with any python interpreter even though it is using the [`mpi4py`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io)
library in the background it is not necessary to execute the script with `mpiexec` or `mpirun`:
```
python test_mpi.py
>>> [(3, 2, 0), (3, 2, 1)]
```
The response consists of a list of two tuples, one for each MPI parallel process, with the first entry of the tuple 
being the parameter `i=3`, followed by the number of MPI parallel processes assigned to the function call `cores_per_worker=2`
and finally the index of the specific process `0` or `1`. 

### GPU Assignment
With the rise of machine learning applications, the use of GPUs for scientific application becomes more and more popular.
Consequently, it is essential to have full control over the assignment of GPUs to specific python functions. In the 
`test_gpu.py` example the `tensorflow` library is used to identify the GPUs and return their configuration: 
```python
import socket
from pympipool import Executor
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib

def get_available_gpus():
    local_device_protos = device_lib.list_local_devices()
    return [
        (x.name, x.physical_device_desc, socket.gethostname()) 
        for x in local_device_protos if x.device_type == 'GPU'
    ]

with Executor(
    max_workers=2, 
    gpus_per_worker=1, 
) as exe:
    fs_1 = exe.submit(get_available_gpus)
    fs_2 = exe.submit(get_available_gpus)

print(fs_1.result(), fs_2.result())
```
The additional parameter `gpus_per_worker=1` specifies that one GPU is assigned to each worker. This functionality 
requires `pympipool` to be connected to a resource manager like the [SLURM workload manager](https://www.schedmd.com)
or preferably the [flux framework](https://flux-framework.org). The rest of the script follows the previous examples, 
as two functions are submitted and the results are printed. 

To clarify the execution of such an example on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster using the [SLURM workload manager](https://www.schedmd.com)
the submission script is given below: 
```shell
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1
#SBATCH --get-user-env=L

python test_gpu.py
```
The important part is that for using the `pympipool.slurm.PySlurmExecutor` backend the script `test_gpu.py` does not 
need to be executed with `srun` but rather it is sufficient to just execute it with the python interpreter. `pympipool`
internally calls `srun` to assign the individual resources to a given worker. 

For the more complex setup of running the [flux framework](https://flux-framework.org) as a secondary resource scheduler
within the [SLURM workload manager](https://www.schedmd.com) it is essential that the resources are passed from the 
[SLURM workload manager](https://www.schedmd.com) to the [flux framework](https://flux-framework.org). This is achieved
by calling `srun flux start` in the submission script: 
```shell
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1
#SBATCH --get-user-env=L

srun flux start python test_gpu.py
```
As a result the GPUs available on the two compute nodes are reported: 
```
>>> [('/device:GPU:0', 'device: 0, name: Tesla V100S-PCIE-32GB, pci bus id: 0000:84:00.0, compute capability: 7.0', 'cn138'),
>>>  ('/device:GPU:0', 'device: 0, name: Tesla V100S-PCIE-32GB, pci bus id: 0000:84:00.0, compute capability: 7.0', 'cn139')]
```
In this case each compute node `cn138` and `cn139` is equipped with one `Tesla V100S-PCIE-32GB`.

## External Executables
While `pympipool` was initially designed for up-scaling python functions for HPC, the same functionality can be leveraged
to up-scale any executable independent of the programming language it is developed in. This approach follows the design 
of the `flux.job.FluxExecutor` included in the [flux framework](https://flux-framework.org). In `pympipool` this approach
is extended to support any kind of subprocess, so it is no longer limited to the [flux framework](https://flux-framework.org).

### Subprocess
Following the [`subprocess.check_output()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) interface of the standard
python libraries, any kind of command can be submitted to the `pympipool.SubprocessExecutor`. The command can either be 
specified as a list `["echo", "test"]` in which the first entry is typically the executable followed by the corresponding
parameters or the command can be specified as a string `"echo test"` with the additional parameter `shell=True`.
```python
from pympipool import SubprocessExecutor

with SubprocessExecutor(max_workers=2) as exe:
    future = exe.submit(["echo", "test"], universal_newlines=True)
    print(future.done(), future.result(), future.done())
>>> (False, "test", True)
```
In analogy to the previous examples the `SubprocessExecutor` class is directly imported from the `pympipool` module and 
the maximum number of workers is set to two `max_workers=2`. In contrast to the `pympipool.Executor` class no other
settings to assign specific hardware to the command via the python interface are available in the `SubprocessExecutor` 
class. To specify the hardware requirements for the individual commands, the user has to manually assign the resources
using the commands of the resource schedulers like `srun`, `flux run` or `mpiexec`.

The `concurrent.futures.Future` object returned after submitting a command to the `pymipool.SubprocessExecutor` behaves
just like any other future object. It provides a `done()` function to check if the execution completed as well as a 
`result()` function to return the output of the submitted command. 

In comparison to the `flux.job.FluxExecutor` included in the [flux framework](https://flux-framework.org) the 
`pymipool.SubprocessExecutor` differs in two ways. One the `pymipool.SubprocessExecutor` does not provide any option for
resource assignment and two the `pymipool.SubprocessExecutor` returns the output of the command rather than just 
returning the exit status when calling `result()`. 

### Interactive Shell
Beyond external executables which are called once with a set of input parameters and or input files and return one set
of outputs, there are some executables which allow the user to interact with the executable during the execution. The 
challenge of interfacing a python process with such an interactive executable is to identify when the executable is ready
to receive the next input. A very basis example for an interactive executable is a script which counts to the number 
input by the user. This can be written in python as `count.py`:
```python
def count(iterations):
    for i in range(int(iterations)):
        print(i)
    print("done")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        user_input = input()
        if "shutdown" in user_input:
            break
        else:
            count(iterations=int(user_input))
```
This example is challenging in terms of interfacing it with a python process as the length of the output changes depending
on the input. The first option that the `pympipool.ShellExecutor` provides is specifying the number of lines to read for
each call submitted to the executable using the `lines_to_read` parameter. In comparison to the `SubprocessExecutor` 
defined above the `ShellExecutor` only supports the execution of a single executable at a time, correspondingly the input
parameters for calling the executable are provided at the time of initialization of the `ShellExecutor` and the inputs 
are submitted using the `submit()` function:
```python
from pympipool import ShellExecutor

with ShellExecutor(["python", "count.py"], universal_newlines=True) as exe:
    future_lines = exe.submit(string_input="4", lines_to_read=5)
    print(future_lines.done(), future_lines.result(), future_lines.done())
```
```
>>> (False, "0\n1\n2\n3\ndone\n", True)
```
The response for a given set of input is again returned as `concurrent.futures.Future` object, this allows the user to
execute other steps on the python side while waiting for the completion of the external executable. In this case the 
example counts the numbers from `0` to `3` and prints each of them in one line followed by `done` to notify the user its
waiting for new inputs. This results in `n+1` lines of output for the input of `n`. Still predicting the number of lines
for a given input can be challenging, so the `pympipool.ShellExecutor` class also provides the option to wait until a 
specific pattern is found in the output using the `stop_read_pattern`:
```python
from pympipool import ShellExecutor

with ShellExecutor(["python", "count.py"], universal_newlines=True) as exe:
    future_pattern = exe.submit(string_input="4", stop_read_pattern="done")
    print(future_pattern.done(), future_pattern.result(), future_pattern.done())
```
```
>>> (False, "0\n1\n2\n3\ndone\n", True)
```
In this example the pattern simply searches for the string `done` in the output of the program and returns all the output
gathered from the executable since the last input as the result of the `concurrent.futures.Future` object returned after
the submission of the interactive command.
